## Volunteering at PyCon Canada 2016
We're all looking forward to the great conference in November and the organizing team is working hard to make this happen, but we can't do it alone.
We'll launch a formal Call for Volunteers as the conference approaches.  
Get in touch and we'll make sure to notify you when it's launched: <volunteers@pycon.ca>
