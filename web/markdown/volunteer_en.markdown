## Volunteering at PyCon Canada 2016
We're all looking forward to the great conference in November -the organizing team is working hard to make this happen, but we can't do it alone.

Volunteers **must be registered** to volunteer, but we welcome **all attendees** to lend a hand. We very much appreciate any assistance you can give us.

We'll launch a formal Call for Volunteers as the conference approaches.  
Sign up to the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bs9mG9) and you'll be notified about how to sign up when we launch!
